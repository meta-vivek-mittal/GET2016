Assignment 1: 
By using Heap data structure techniques write a program to handle the jobs sent to the admin department's printer: Jobs sent by 
the department chair should be printed first, then jobs sent by professors, then those sent by graduate students, and finally 
those sent by undergraduates. The job put into as per the priority of the sender (e.g., using 4 for the chair, 3 for professors, 
2 for grad students, and 1 for undergrads), and the associated information would be the document to print. Each time the printer 
is free, the job with the highest priority would be removed from the print queue, and printed. (Note there could be multiple jobs 
with the same)  
 
 Following operations must be satisfied by program:
 
 1. create an empty priority queue for JOB
 2. Insertion of new JOB
