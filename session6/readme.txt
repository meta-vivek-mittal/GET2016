- Perform sorting on this collection i.e natural order.
- Perform sorting on this collection based on the employee Name. (ascending order by Employee Name)
- Create a collection for these employees to avoid any duplicate employee entry. (Employee having same empId will consider as duplicate. 
If one try to add the same employe again it should avoid that.)

Assignment 2:

Write a method that takes a string and returns the number of unique characters in the string. It is expected that a string with the same
character sequence may be passed several times to the method. Since the counting operation can be time consuming, the methods should 
cache the results, so that when the methods is given a string previously encountered, it will simply retrieve the stored result. Use 
collection and maps where appropriate.
